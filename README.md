# Game Engine Research

This repository is aim to determine which tools (mainly Game Eninges) will be suitable (according to my personal preferences) in order to make a mobile Game. In order to achieve I will be building the same game using different tools in order to able to compare them.

## Engines or Tools to compare
* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [GODOT](https://godotengine.org/)
* [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/?sessionInvalidated=true)

## Assets
